      <h1><a href="/blog/2015/03/31/new-logspout-extensible-docker-logging/">New Logspout: Extensible Docker Logging</a></h1>
      <p class="sub">Jeff Lindsay wrote this on
        March

        2015</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout">Logspout</a> is a Docker container for stateless, host-level log forwarding. It was designed specifically for Docker container logs. It&rsquo;s one of the earliest standalone components built for the Docker ecosystem, and the canonical way to deal with Docker logs for many.</p>

<p>After Glider Labs adopted the project, we updated and automated its build and release process, switched it to <a href="http://gliderlabs.com/blog/2015/03/20/our-minimal-alpine-linux-image-joins-docker-official-images/">Alpine</a>, and took care of a few long standing bugs. Our next release will focus on a re-architected version that is more modular and more extensible.</p>

<p>You can try it now in master <code>HEAD</code>, which is also tagged on Docker Hub as <code>:master</code>. In preparation for the next release, let us tell you more about it.</p>

<h3>Modules</h3>

<p>Logspout now includes a concept of modules, similar to, say, Nginx modules. Modules are chunks of functionality added or removed at compile-time. In our case, they&rsquo;re added or removed at Docker build-time, with no need for you to set up or install any compiler toolchain.</p>

<p>Managing modules happens in a <code>modules.go</code> source file that is intended for operators to edit. Although it&rsquo;s a Go source file, think of it like a configuration file. No real knowledge of Go is necessary. It looks like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight go"><code><span class="k">package</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">main</span><span class="x">

</span><span class="k">import</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/adapters/raw"</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/adapters/syslog"</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/httpstream"</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/routesapi"</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/transports/tcp"</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/transports/udp"</span><span class="x">
</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="x">
</span></code></pre>

<p>These are the default modules used in Logspout. It&rsquo;s safe to remove any of these lines to drop a module. You can also add lines pointing to new Logspout module packages. These packages can live in any repository, allowing you to build your own modules without forking or pushing upstream to the logspout repository.</p>

<p>Editing this file seems to suggest you&rsquo;d need to fork the logspout repository to make a custom build, but you don&rsquo;t. We let you customize <code>modules.go</code> with an <code>ONBUILD</code> hook. With this, making a custom build of Logspout that follows official releases is extremely easy. <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/custom">Here is an example.</a></p>

<h3>Adapters and Transports</h3>

<p>Previously, the idea of a &ldquo;Logspout adapter&rdquo; was just a hardcoded function mapping in Logspout. We started with an RFC 3164 &ldquo;syslog&rdquo; adapter, then others contributed two more: a JSON over UDP adapter, and a separate &ldquo;rfc5424&rdquo; adapter for modern syslog. People also asked for TCP syslog, or hacked in support for other adapters like RabbitMQ and Kafka.</p>

<p>Using modules, we now have a real API for adding new and externally maintained adapters. We also support different transports, which can be used by adapters to prevent needing to create adapters for each type of possible transport. For example, the new syslog adapter lets you use UDP, TCP, or any other transport added in the future, such as perhaps <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/blob/master/transports/tls/tls.go">TLS</a>.</p>

<p>We then redesigned our built-in adapters. There is now a single syslog adapter that supports both RFC 5425 (default) and RFC 3164. It&rsquo;s more configurable and out of the box has more sensible defaults. There&rsquo;s also a raw adapter that allows generalized templated log messages over any supported transport.</p>

<h3>Extension Points</h3>

<p>For those interested in writing adapters, or are curious about our extension architecture, Logspout modules are enabled by <a href="https://github.com/progrium/go-extpoints">go-extpoints</a>. This is a library and generator for building extension points in Go programs. Extension points are a mechanism for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">inversion of control</a>, similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a>. Each extension point represents a part of Logspout that a module can hook into.</p>

<p>Here is a list of current extension point types in Logspout. Some are more advanced or internally used than others, but are available to module authors nonetheless.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AdapterFactory</strong> - allows you to add new types of route adapters (syslog, Kafka, etc)</li>
<li><strong>AdapterTransport</strong> - allows you to add new adapter transports (UDP, TLS, etc)</li>
<li><strong>HttpHandler</strong> - allows you to add new top level endpoints to the HTTP service</li>
<li><strong>Job</strong> - allows you to add parallel running tasks (HTTP server, container pump, etc)</li>
<li><strong>LogRouter</strong> - allows you to add new log routing intakes (containers, syslog, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Extension <em>points</em> are package singletons where you register and access objects implementing the type for that extension point. Extension <em>types</em> like those listed above each have their own extension point. Extension types are either a Go interface, where an extension must implement the interface methods, or a function signature type definition, where an extension is literally a callback function.</p>

<p>Here is the simplest example of a module package hooking into an extension point. We implement the <code>HttpHandler</code> function signature, which just says to return a Go <code>http.Handler</code>, and register it with the <code>HttpHandlers</code> extension point on package initialization.</p>
<pre class="highlight go"><code><span class="k">package</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="x">

</span><span class="k">import</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="x">
  </span><span class="s">"github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/router"</span><span class="x">
  </span><span class="s">"net/http"</span><span class="x">
</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="x">

</span><span class="k">func</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="x">

  </span><span class="n">mux</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NewServeMux</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="x">
  </span><span class="n">mux</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HandleFunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"/hello"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="k">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ResponseWriter</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Request</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Write</span><span class="p">([]</span><span class="kt">byte</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello!"</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="x">
  </span><span class="p">})</span><span class="x">
  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">mux</span><span class="x">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="x">

</span></code></pre>

<p>Adding an import for this package in <code>modules.go</code> and rebuilding will add a new <code>/hello</code> endpoint to the Logspout web server.</p>

<p>For more examples, check out the other default modules in the Logspout repository such as <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/httpstream">httpstream</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/routesapi">routesapi</a>, and of course the <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/adapters">adapter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/transports">transport</a> modules. Even much of the core Logspout <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/router">router package</a> is implemented with extension points.</p>

<h3>Docker Log Drivers</h3>

<p>Docker itself is about to <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7195">support log drivers</a>. This introduces improvements to current Docker logging, and lets you recompile Docker with new log drivers.</p>

<p>Logspout will continue to be an easier and more configurable solution for drop-in container log forwarding. The built-in log drivers in Docker will actually help many Logspout deployments, since you&rsquo;ll be able to disable Docker writing logs to local disk. Let Logspout forward logs to where they should really be.</p>

      <p>In August 2000, while Rob Pike was still at Bell Labs and before he co-developed Go, he gave a talk called <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utah2000/">Systems Software Research is Irrelevant</a>. Today the situation is perhaps not as dire. At the very least, his examples are noticeably dated. However, many of his points remain true and point at systemic roadblocks to better systems software.</p>

<p>His main point was that academic research around systems software had lost the influence on industry it once had. The rise of Google and its academically inclined engineering culture is maybe the biggest shift since this talk. Google has applied and published great research on software systems, particularly around distributed systems.</p>

<p>That said, there are points from this talk that resonate with and inspire people like us trying to fill the void of modern systems R&amp;D.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Startups are too focused on short time scale and practical results to try new things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first I thought, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; Then I realized what startups really do is often take the opportunity to apply <em>recent</em> ideas (ie Docker), but rarely do they (nor should they) try to <em>invent</em> novel approaches to systems.</p>

<p>Instead, invention most often comes from organizations large enough to necessitate invention for their particular problem and scale, or startup vendors that are trying to sell a shiny new solution. This has yielded great papers, best practices, and open source software, but in all cases these are independent solutions to specific problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go back to thinking about and <em>building systems</em>. Narrowness is irrelevant; breadth is relevant: it&rsquo;s the essence of <em>system</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one vendor will provide a solution for your entire system. There are virtualization vendors, CI vendors, source control vendors, operating system vendors, configuration management vendors, database vendors, container management vendors, and on and on.</p>

<p>Whether these are hosted services or commercially supported open source software, none of them will ever solve (read: own) the system. No matter what they think or what they tell you.</p>

<p>Instead, we collectively share best practices and loosely converge on similar system architectures. But who has the incentive and business platform that can support <em>systemic</em> innovation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been much talk about component architectures but only one true success: Unix pipes. It should be possible to build interactive and distributed applications from piece parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a guiding hypothesis behind the Glider Labs approach to building systems, this is it. Rarely does this get a chance to be fully explored.</p>

      <p>When building Docker delivery pipelines, image size is extremely important for fast deploys. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s too easy to make Docker images over 1GB in size. This is true even when you use many of the official images. It&rsquo;s especially true with many third-party base images. Dockerfile optimization is usually our first priority with clients.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> has become our distribution of choice for minimal containers. Since discovering Alpine, we&rsquo;ve been maintaining what&rsquo;s become a fairly popular Docker image for it called <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gliderlabs/alpine/"><code>gliderlabs/alpine</code></a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been porting many of our open source containers like <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout">logspout</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator">registrator</a> to it. Although it&rsquo;s not ideal for every situation, we were still surprised it was not in the Docker standard library. So we began preparing ours to be submitted.</p>

<p>This week we&rsquo;re happy to announce that our image is now merged into the Docker library as an <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/alpine/">official image</a>. You can now build Alpine Linux based containers with simply <code>FROM alpine</code>.</p>

<p>You can also continue to use <code>gliderlabs/alpine</code>. We use the same <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine">repository</a> and <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/gliderlabs/docker-alpine">open build process</a> to build <code>alpine</code> as <code>gliderlabs/alpine</code>. There are slight differences, but are effectively the same.</p>

<p>Whichever one you use, we hope you enjoy using Alpine Linux with Docker!</p>

      <p>It may not be obvious, but Glider Labs is named after the glider pattern in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway&rsquo;s Life</a>. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, Conway&rsquo;s Life is a popular cellular automaton that exhibits how simple rules can lead to complex behavior.</p>

<p>Specifically, Conway&rsquo;s Life is a simple simulation with cells that can either be on or off at each step. Every step, four simple rules are executed dealing with the state of a cell&rsquo;s neighbors. From this, you get what seems to be a disproportionate amount of rich, dynamic behavior.</p>

<p><img alt="Conway's Life" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/8Ar9S6zEFjJiU/giphy.gif" /></p>

<p>Key takeaways from Conway&rsquo;s Life are about complexity and emergence. A well constructed initial pattern of only a few cells in Life can grow into an entire ecosystem of interesting patterns.</p>

<p>A minor change to the initial pattern has a tremendous effect on how the pattern evolves. While the system is deterministic, the dynamics of it are not terribly intuitive. You rarely know how a change will cascade through the lifespan of a Life simulation unless you built it up from scratch yourself.</p>

<p>Murphy&rsquo;s law is an unavoidable truth in operations and reliability engineering. Root cause analysis usually proves major system failures not to be random, but an unexpected series of smaller, cascading failures. This is the nature of failure and predictability in complex systems, and it&rsquo;s fascinating how well this is captured in models like Conway&rsquo;s Life.</p>

<p><img alt="Complex Life system" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/tXlpbXfu7e2Pu/giphy.gif" /></p>

<p>Studying complexity and emergence in Conway&rsquo;s Life also reveals useful truths in designing everyday software systems. Although there are infinite possible simulations in Life, you quickly notice that all complex patterns are made up of just a few simple patterns that keep recurring.</p>

<p>These useful patterns can be arranged in countless ways to compose more complex useful patterns. Complex patterns can then be combined as modules to make even more complex patterns. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>In case these patterns seem pointless, it may be worth mentioning that Conway&rsquo;s Life is <a href="http://jeremykun.com/2011/06/30/turing-machines-and-conways-dreams/">Turing complete</a>. As such, you can implement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8">Conway&rsquo;s Life in Conway&rsquo;s Life</a>.</p>

<p>This only scratches the surface of what can be gleaned from studying Conway&rsquo;s Life. There are plenty of ways to play with Life simulations, including implementing one yourself. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/nr2wehptjW">runnable Go implementation</a> in about 100 lines.</p>

<p>The glider pattern we reference is the smallest traveling pattern in Life, and one of the most useful building blocks. It&rsquo;s often used as a symbol of Conway&rsquo;s Life, but has also been adopted to <a href="http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/faqs.html">represent the hacker ethic</a>. This is a convenient symbolic addition for us.</p>

<p>All of this gets at how we think about problems, design systems, and captures the realities of our field. This is why we are Glider Labs.</p>
