      <p>This year we attended the second annual DockerCon in San Francisco. We almost didn&rsquo;t, as our proposed talks were passed on. My abstracts are often generic sounding placeholders, so I don&rsquo;t blame the conference organizers for skipping over an original Docker team member. Regardless, a month before the event, I got an invitation to moderate lightning talks, as well as to give one.</p>

<p>Separately, our work with Docker, ClusterHQ, and Weaveworks on Docker plugins was announced at the keynote. They gave the three of us a session to introduce Docker plugins in more detail. ClusterHQ has <a href="https://clusterhq.com/2015/07/01/docker-plugins-complete-the-puzzle/">a nice write-up</a>, though The New Stack also has <a href="http://thenewstack.io/the-real-docker-ecosystem-launches-with-plugins/">a good write-up</a> as industry press. I was just pleasantly surprised to see the Glider Labs logo in Solomon&rsquo;s keynote. (However, I&rsquo;m not sure why Mesosphere is mentioned at all.)</p>

<p><img alt="Conway's Life" src="/images/dockercon2015.jpg" /></p>

<p>Besides that it was really great to hear from so many people using Glider Labs projects. Our Alpine image is definitely a hit. We saw a number of Docker employees using it in their demos. Talking to vendors at the booths, it seemed 90% of them were using a Glider Labs project of some kind, whether Alpine, Registrator, or Logspout. This is especially exciting because these projects are just the beginning.</p>

<p>The lightning talks were also fun. I used my lightning talk as an excuse to put together a proof of concept for a project now called Envy. It&rsquo;s a sort of development environment manager, re-envisioning the idea of development environments with containers. I believe somebody suggested it could be a Vagrant killer? I gave the demo several times at DockerCon and it was quite well received.</p>

<p>Definitely looking forward to next year!</p>

      <p>We often talk about complexity in software systems, but for some reason we don&rsquo;t seem to talk enough about simplicity. I was quite happy to find that Rich Hickey&rsquo;s keynote at Strange Loop 2011 focused on simplicity.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Rich Hickey - Simple Made Easy on InfoQ</a></strong> (<a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md">transcript</a>)</p>

<p>Simple Made Easy is about Hickey&rsquo;s exploration of what simple really means, what it doesn&rsquo;t mean, and how that can be used as a guide towards simplicity in software.</p>

<p>Most experienced programmers know that simplicity is difficult to achieve. Perhaps part of the reason for this is that simplicity seems to be somewhat subjective. Here, Hickey explains a framework to more objectively identify how simple a design is.</p>

<p><center><img alt="Simple as not interleaved" src="/images/simple_made_easy.jpg" /></center></p>

<p>He starts with the etymology of simple. It describes a meaning around the amount of <em>interleaving</em>. What&rsquo;s interesting is that this interpretation of simplicity is not about the number of elements, just how interleaved they are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is not about counting. I&rsquo;d rather have more things hanging nice, straight down, not twisted together, than just a couple of things tied in a knot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To help with this particular meaning of simple, he shares an archaic word that is specifically the opposite of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>complect</strong> - to interleave, entwine, or braid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By using complecting as our primary anti-pattern, we can more easily see a path towards simplicity than the vague notion of &ldquo;avoiding complexity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also identifies that simple is not the same as easy, despite many using those words interchangeably. While easy is ultimately relative, simple in these terms has some objectivity to it. We can ask, &ldquo;How much interleaving is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The talk goes over a number tactical approaches to simplicity by not complecting, but there&rsquo;s also wisdom shared around the value of simplicity.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest issue with complexity is that it undermines understanding your software. He makes the point that understanding is the real key to making changes quickly in software.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom says testing is how we can make changes quickly. While there is clearly value in testing, the popular notion that test coverage above all else is what you need to move quickly is challenged by Hickey. He calls it guardrail programming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s true of every bug found in the field? It passed all the tests. So now what do you do? I think we&rsquo;re in this world I&rsquo;d like to call guardrail programming. It&rsquo;s really sad. We&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;I can make change because I have tests!&rdquo; Who does that? Who drives their car around banging against the guardrail saying, &ldquo;Whoa! I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve got these guardrails because I&rsquo;d never make it to the show on time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you find a bug, tests only tell you what the problem isn&rsquo;t. You have to reason about the program, debug it, try things. If the program is complex, this is harder to do. The only way to improve this process is if the program is simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compared to the complexity we can create, we&rsquo;re all statistically at the same point in our ability to understand it, which is not very good. So we&rsquo;re going to have to bring things towards us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a lot of great insight in this talk. As a final point, let&rsquo;s remember that simplicity doesn&rsquo;t just happen. It&rsquo;s not the default mode of software engineering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is a choice. It requires constant vigilance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need more thinking around simplicity. If you know of other great talks on simplicity, in software or otherwise, please share in the comments.</p>

      <p>Today we&rsquo;re happy to introduce <a href="http://weave.works/">Weaveworks</a>, authors of <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/weave">Weave</a>, as our newest sponsor. This sponsorship will most immediately support development and increased releases of <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator">Registrator</a>, our Docker service discovery bridge. It also enables us to release a few new projects in this space over the next couple months.</p>

<p>This six month sponsorship not only supports our work, but the joint effort across vendors to help Docker become more extensible. Along with Weaveworks, we&rsquo;re among a few working with Docker to help design a plugin system, initially allowing basic extension points around networking and volumes.</p>

<p>It also means we&rsquo;ll be exploring integration with various Weave components, such as Registrator with <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/tree/master/weavedns">WeaveDNS</a>. We&rsquo;ll also be sharing some of the use cases with current and future Weave services for Docker software networking.</p>

<p>Besides our consulting and system integration services, Glider Labs is an independent systems R&amp;D lab. Our open source work towards unraveling the <a href="http://gliderlabs.com/blog/2015/03/24/the-modern-systems-software-mess/">modern systems mess</a> is made possible by sponsorships like this. If your organization is interested in supporting our work the way Weaveworks has, please <a href="mailto:team+sponsor@gliderlabs.com">let us know</a>.</p>

      <h1><a href="/blog/2015/04/14/docker-events-explained/">Docker Events Explained</a></h1>
      <p class="sub">Matt Good wrote this on

      <p>One of the fantastic features of the Docker platform is the events API. This enables tools like <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator">Registrator</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout">Logspout</a> to listen for container events like starting and stopping, then act on them.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.17/#monitor-dockers-events">Docker API documentation</a> provides a list of the available events, but does not include much detail on what they mean and when they will occur. Since many of our tools depend on the events API, we&rsquo;ve put together a chart illustrating the events triggered throughout the lifecycle of a Docker container (as of Docker version 1.5 / API version 1.17):</p>

<p><a href="/images/docker_events.png"><img width="650px" height="371px" alt="Docker events diagram" src="/images/docker_events.png" title="Container-related Docker events" /></a></p>

<p>A few container-related events are not included in this illustration since they are not affected by container state:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>export</strong> emitted by <code>docker export</code></li>
<li><strong>exec_create</strong> emitted by <code>docker exec</code></li>
<li><strong>exec_start</strong> also emitted by <code>docker exec</code> after <strong>exec_create</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also several events not in this diagram that are related to Docker images rather than containers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>import</strong> emitted by <code>docker import</code></li>
<li><strong>pull</strong> emitted by <code>docker pull</code></li>
<li><strong>untag</strong> emitted by <code>docker rmi</code></li>
<li><strong>delete</strong> emitted by <code>docker rmi</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Running <code>docker rmi</code> emits an <code>untag</code> event when removing an image tag name. The <code>rmi</code> command may also emit <code>delete</code> events for any image IDs deleted, either by deleting an image by ID directly, or deleting the last tag referring to it.</p>

<p>We encourage more people to take advantage of the Docker events API, and we hope this diagram is useful. The Docker team is <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/12164">considering including this diagram in the documentation</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="/images/xerox_parc_1975.jpg" title="Xerox PARC, 1975 via Computer History Museum" /></p>

<p>Desktop computing, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented programming, laser printing, Ethernet. Pillars of modern computing invented by only 25 people over 5 years at one place: Xerox PARC.</p>

<p>Unix and C. Foundations of modern systems software initially developed by just 2 people over 3 years at one place: Bell Labs.</p>

<p>Both happened in the early 1970s. <em>That was over 40 years ago.</em> What exactly have the rest of us been doing since?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking at photos of cats!&rdquo; Okay, but really.</p>

<p>The startup world responds half-jokingly, and perhaps with an air of trademark Silicon Valley superiority, &ldquo;Um, we&rsquo;ve been innovating? You know, bringing all this to market and making it easier to use?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re right! We&rsquo;ve been innovating. That doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad, does it? It&rsquo;s not, but there is a big difference between invention and innovation. <strong>The problem is that innovation feeds on invention, and we&rsquo;ve been feeding on the same inventions for 40 years.</strong></p>

<p>Consumers are not complaining. In fact, they&rsquo;re eating it up. Innovation is clearly where the money is and there&rsquo;s plenty more. Now anybody in Silicon Valley that claims to be inventing is usually lying. Most are proud <em>not</em> to be inventing.</p>

<p>Some say Google X is the new Xerox PARC. No way. Google X is about sexy commercial applications that are extremely risky. Xerox PARC was about researchers&rsquo; independent curiosity and vision. One was set up for &ldquo;pie in the sky&rdquo; innovation, the other was set up for &ldquo;blue sky&rdquo; <em>invention</em>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, systems software and tooling naturally gets more attention when allowed blue sky invention. Put a bunch of computer scientists together and let them do whatever they want. What are they going to do? Odds are they&rsquo;ll design a new programming language. Exactly! I know that&rsquo;s not particularly ideal, but it reveals the inherent bias. Compare that scenario with them being tasked to change the world.</p>

<p>Innovation is great. I&rsquo;m not trying to devalue the work we&rsquo;ve done since the 70s. However, this obsession with innovation clearly devalues invention. Moreover, looking at what are effectively the same tools after 40 years, my concern is that lack of invention stifles major progress in systems software.</p>

<p>The good news is that we&rsquo;ve seen it could only take a handful of people in the right place with the right incentives to make another leap. It just most likely won&rsquo;t be VC backed.</p>
